This sections contains an example application of position DC motor control for NuttX RTOS.
Position is controlled with two PWM outputs and incremental encoder as a feedback. Two GPIO
outputs are specific for Teensy 4.x board in pikron-bb configuration (for detailed description
of the configuration please refer to NuttX documentation) and can be removed for other boards
and configurations.
